          <h4>What are Pay Per Click Ads?</h4>
          <P>Pay Per Click (PPC) ads are online advertisements that appear on search engine results pages (SERPs) when someone searches for specific keywords. These ads are typically placed at the top of the page and are labelled "Sponsored" or "Ad." When someone clicks on the ad, they are directed to the advertiser’s website, and the advertiser pays the search engine for the click.
            PPC ads are an effective way to drive targeted traffic to your website and increase your brand's visibility. With PPC, you can target users based on location, interests, and other criteria. This helps you reach the right people at the right time, which can lead to more conversions. This in turn means that you can customise your campaigns to make sure that you’re spending your budget on the users that are most likely to convert.

            <h4>The importance of Google Ads</h4>

Google Ads also has powerful analytics that allows you to track the performance of your campaigns in real-time, so you can make adjustments as needed.
              	<BR>Google AdWords are also inexpensive. You can set a daily budget and only pay when someone clicks on your ad. This means you won’t waste money on ads that don’t generate clicks. You can also set different bids for different keywords, so you can control how much you pay for each click. Google ads are highly targeted as well. You can target users based on their location, interests, and other criteria, so you can reach the right people at the right time. This can help you get more clicks, more conversions, and a higher ROI.

              	<BR>Finally, Google Ads is highly scalable. You can easily increase or decrease your budget as needed to reach your goals. This makes it easy to adjust your campaigns as your business grows.
